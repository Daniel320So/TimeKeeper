Work

This week I worked on Brainstorming of the features of Timesheet.
- shouldn't require much input data from the user
- can track the time of using coding softwares
- can automatically input data (e.g. date and time) to the timesheet
- can even record the file type that the users were coding on

Here is the link to that work: {[link](https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/TimeKeeper/blob/69080d909519e6858be217e6f362c818128e3b1f/standup-logs/standup-log-TinWaiCheung)}.

This week I worked on discussion in team to divide our group work into 3 aspects, Command line interface, Clockify API and Excel Report.
I joined the Excel Report division as I am more interested in the front-end output.
